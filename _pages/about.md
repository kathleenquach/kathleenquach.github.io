`Hello, world!`

I am a behavioral neuroscientist with ten years of postdoctoral and graduate experience, specializing in decision-making involved in predator-prey interactions between nematode species. Before that, I worked in the network operations center of a large corporation, which I eagerly left to pursue science. As an undergraduate, I was a research and therapy assistant for several labs that focused on childhood autism. I have extensive experience in teaching and mentoring, with focus on helping people with limited resources and training to acquire the fundamental knowledge and skills they need to succeed in science.
