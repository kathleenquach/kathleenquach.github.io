`Hello, world!`

I am a behavioral neuroscientist with ten years of postdoctoral and graduate experience, specializing in decision-making involved in predator-prey interactions between nematode species. Before that, I worked in the network operations center of a large corporation, which I eagerly left to pursue science. As an undergraduate, I was a research and therapy assistant for several labs that focused on childhood autism. I have also done some odd jobs, such as illustration, makeup artistry, and screenplay editing for horror films. 

I am looking for my next research role as staff research associate. I am open to a wide variety of research topics in biology. Rigor, reproducibility, training, and open science are top priorities for me. I currently reside in San Diego, CA, USA, and am willing to relocate.
