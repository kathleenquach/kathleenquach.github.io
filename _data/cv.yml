        - Led projects investigating the decision-making and molecular regulation of foraging decisions by <i>Pristionchus pacificus</i> predatory nematodes in response to predator-prey competition with <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> prey nematodes.
        - Integrated concepts from foraging theory, neuroeconomic theory, and intraguild predation theory to build a behavioral framework that can be used to predict, elicit, and distinguish between predatory and territorial motivations for attacking <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.
